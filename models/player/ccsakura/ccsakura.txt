CHARACTER INFO

I didn't write this following detail myself (Some people out there know how
much I suck in english). I just copied and pasted from this page:
http://wasabi-anime.com/kara/anime/ccs/per1.htm

Name: Sakura Kinomoto
Age: 10 

"Sakura is always cheerful, and will even tell you that.
She loves her dad, and her brother (even though he is kind of a bully to her :).
She has a big crush on her brothers' friend Yukito. Her best friend is Tomoyo,
who happens to love her ^^; and video tapes Sakura as much as she can. 
Sakura mistakenly released the power of the Clow Cards from her fathers basement.
This also awoke the mighty (hehe) Cerberus, Kero chan. She is now the "Card Captor"
and has to return each cards power."

MESH

  995 Tris. (Almost not accepted)
  Tri count goes really high 'cause her costume.
  I sacrificed (8x8 + 4x14 = 52 + 64 =) 116 tris for spheres.
  and about 200 for her hat and skirt.

SKIN

  1x256x256 + 1x128x128
  Custom color generated with TCG, again. It took me to long
  to change tcg parameters to get desired result even if
  I'm the one who wrote it. TCG is still user friendless and
  contains lotta bugs.

  I didn't put much detail on this skin 'cause mainly they were
  shaped out by the mesh.

BONE STRUCTURE
  
  Custom Biped w/ 2x5 Ponytail.
  6x3+2x4 Bones for skirt (Parents are L/R Thigh)
  

ANIMATIONS

  Mixed from Rigell, Hibari, Tsugumi and Valve standard animations
  Hibari/Tsugumi - Knee crawl
  Hibari/Tsugumi - Deadposes
  Rigell 	 - Aim/Swing crowbar, rpg, glock
  Valve	  	 - Deadposes, jump, etc,.

  ALL NEW ANIMATION:
    Longjump.
    Swim - altered from valve's Treadwater
  
  ADDED:
    Idle, crouch_idle, crawl, longjump, jump, deadposes, swim/treadwater
    contain skirt animations.

COMMENTS

- I wish I could create every pieces of her hair!!!!!!
  If there is no polylimit I'm gonna...!!A&R)_#$. ARrrh!
- I'm about to impliment eye trick feature (thanks to Fey) in this
  model but the polycount reached its limit... So I think I'll save that
  for the next one.
- This model doesn't take as much time as Tsugumi. Although Sakura bones
  are more than Tsugumi's, they are always idle in aim/shoot animations.
  Also I don't pay attention to hat animation as much as Tsugumi hair.
  The quality of its animation is lower, though.



HAVE FUN!
