Half-Life Modder's Perspective

I remember back in the days when I started doing mods for Half-Life (somewhere around 2005 I think), 
I was amazed how collection of dots can be turned into polygons and how then you can skin them to get something that will be rendered as a "real" thing in the game engine. 
The revelation was an eyeopener. 

Some times afterwards, I was thinking about making a pack of models to show how a real Half-Life Mod maker actually sees the 3D models... 

So... many years later, this pack will be finally unleashed to the Half-Life Community. 



In this pack you will find 5 models alongside 5 Preview images:

Bipped - Representation of the Half-Life "skeleton" used for animating the players.

FlatShade - Well just like the name suggest that's a FlatShaded view of a player model, for extra effect I added red wireframe overlay. 

HitBox - Well, this is a representation of the Half-Life Player model's hitboxes. 
That's what causes the engine to register ballet hits and what causes you to take "damage" when hit in the game. 

NormalMap - Well, this is how the player model would have looked like if the Normal maps for the model were used for Diffuse maps...

WireFrame - Well, this is a wireframe render mode of the player model, for added effect I included the skeleton to show up. 

This pack is compiled for Half-Life and for SvenCoop. 
Make sure to download the correct one, depending on what you plan to use it for. 
The player models in the Half-Life version of the pack will also work in Opposing Force.

So go grab them, and play the game from the Modder's Perspective...
