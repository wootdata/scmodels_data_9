This model is Gordon Freeman in it's lab-coat.

Feel free to distribute this model.
If you wanna release it in a compilation don't forget to contact me.

====================================================================

Place the 'Dr_Freeman' folder in your half-life\valve\models\player folder.

The .mdl file is the model you will see during play.  The .bmp file is
necessary for the model to be selectable via the launcher interface.  For
a player model to be visible to all clients playing, it must be installed on
the server for it to propogate to all playing clients.

When a model is downloaded from the game server, it does not download the
.bmp file necessary for selecting the model in the interface: models must be
deliberately installed by the player.
