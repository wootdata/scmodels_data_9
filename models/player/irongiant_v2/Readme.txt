Other Info: 
This is my first attempt at making a model.
The character is from the Warner Bros. animated film "The Iron Giant".
If you have not seen this film, see it soon. It is incredible.

The model was created in MilkShape 3D and the skin was created in Photoshop.

Since it is a metal robot, I chose to not make his shoulders move with the clavicle
bone, which would require the chest to bend. That didn't seem right. But, since I couldn't
change the way the bones moved, his arm/shoulder socket travels around a bit. 
In battle, you can't see much anyway, so I figured it wouldn't be that big a deal.

Enjoy.
