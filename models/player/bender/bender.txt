All credit for the model itself goes to the original creator (see readme.txt) ;)

I converted to SC4.0b animations and adjusted some things to make it look more like Bender!
I also updated the preview image. 


bender_ORIG.bmp: I renamed the original preview image that came with the model but left the image itself unmodified.
bender_ORIG.mdl: Original model w/original HL:DM animations and original texture.
readme.txt: original "readme" that came with the model (unmodified).
