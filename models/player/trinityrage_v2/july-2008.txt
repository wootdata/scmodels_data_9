July, 2008:

-Added custom Matrix-like animations that were with the DM version of this model.
-Adjusted skin to compensate for "UV-shift."

That is all


This particular model has been around a LONG time - HL Deathmatch, as well as Sven Coop. Therefore, I see no reason to take credit for something as simple as adding animations.
