Known bugs:
On some of the weapon animations, the hands disconnect.
I'll admit, the skin isn't the best, but using a mouse to draw on a computer is near nigh impossible for me.
I'd really prefer a flat pressure sensitive tablet pad.  Then my real drawing talent could shine through.   

Description:
He's fast. He's suave. He' can dodge bullets while singing the opening portion of Pierre Montalbe's Ro' Del' Marche.
He' BOB, Robot, Friend, and master of alien ass whupping.
Bob's Personal Favorite Music is "The Girl from Impenama".

Installation:

Model Files:  Just place that pretty little folder with name bob on it in the models folder under the player.  It's "That" simple.
Optional Extras:  I plan to make at lease one custom weapon for Bob.  What it will be, when it will be finished, and when will it be released
is quite unknown to me.


Distribution:
Distribute these models freely - as a set or individually, but please include the text files.
