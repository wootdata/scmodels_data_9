This is converted Team Fortress Model (one of a complete set).

Basically I updated the animations and converted the model to full
greyscale colors and matched the textures used in the greyscale map.

All of the graphics work was done using Microsoft Imager2,
Wally, Photostyler, mgi Photosuite, and any other tool that
let me do what I needed.

All the compiling and decompiling and other bone related work
was done in Milkshape 1.5.10.

All the texture application was done directly in the very
nice Half-Life Model Viewer V1.24 by Mete Ciragan.

The total modification took about 1 hour from start to
finish (I'm getting better at this stuff lol).

Info:

Files included:
BWsniper.mdl - The HLDM player version of the game BWsniper model file
BWsniper.bmp - The picture you see when selecting the model in the game
BWsniper.txt - This text file

Place BWsniper.mdl, BWsniper.bmp, BWsniper.jpg and BWsniper.txt in a
new folder called BWsniper, in valve\models\player folder in your Half
Life directory.

** IMPORTANT NOTICE **
This model should NOT be distributed in any kind of commercial
compilation, product or package without my personal approval.

This model CAN otherwise be distributed freely as long as this text
file is included, unmodified, with the package.

And PLEASE don't extract the skin and draw a mustache or remove the
clothes from it and release it to the world as yours, don't be lame.
(thanks to NSi for the notice).
