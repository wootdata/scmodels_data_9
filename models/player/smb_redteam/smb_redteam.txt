**Description:
--------------

Super Mario from the Super Mario Bros games. What more do you
need to know?

================================================================

**Extra Description:
--------------

Unlike non-Nintendo mascots such as Sonic the Hedgehog and Crash
Bandicoot, Mario was in a trio of successful arcade games before
hitting the consoles with full force. Mario first appeared in
Donkey Kong, which established the standard formula of a Mario
game: the antagonist (DK / Bowser / Tatanga) abducts Mario's
girlfriend (Pauline / Princess Toadstool / Daisy), and Mario must
travel through zany settings in order to beat the bad guy and
free the damsel in distress. After Donkey Kong, Mario appeared
in Donkey Kong Jr., and then in Mario Bros., which was Mario's
last pre-NES arcade hit. Mario Bros. introduced the other brother,
Luigi, and there we got a first glimpse of Mario as a plumber. 

After the successful arcade games, Nintendo used Mario's ever-
ncreasing popularity to promote their new systems. For example,
a multi-cartridge containing Super Mario Bros. was bundled with
the NES, and Super Mario World was bundled with early versions
of the Super NES. Using this marketing tactic, it wasn't long
before Mario became synonymous with Nintendo. 

Motivated only by a job well done (or maybe Peach's kiss...),
Mario seems to enjoy his many adventures. Taking time out from
stomping and smashing with reckless abandon, Mario will often
flash a smile and the V-sign before continuing his relentless
assualt on the bad guys. Perhaps this is why Bowser despises
Mario; Mario always wins, and wins while having fun.

**Acknowledgements:
-------------------

This is my first offically completed Quake 3: Arena model, but
hopefully won't be my last. I would like to thank the academy, Nintendo, Mario Himself, sundance, the polycount community and more than anyone Goatman.

**Construction:
---------------

The construction information is all a blur to me. I don't remember
when i started this model because i create models and dump them and
come back to them after several months. He was built using Milkshape
3D and 3D Studio Max 4. And animated in Max using Character Studio.


====================Super Mario Animations======================

_Goatman_ quoteth - 
"Craig said that he wanted the animations to stay as true as
possible. to the Nintendo 64 version of Mario  I played around
with several ideas and thought I'd integrate the "stars" into some
of the animations.  Also, Craig wanted blinking eyes and x's in the
eyes on the death sequences.  This was accomplished by creating
duplicate polygons for the eyes and mapping them with a shader
for the blink animation.  If it's possible to have more than 8
frames in a shader animation, I couldn't figure out how, so the
blink speed is off from the original.  The X's were accomplished
the same way.  The blink polygons are part of the head, while the
x's polygons are part of the torso.  With some care, I aligned
the x's to the blink during the deaths... as soon as a character
is in a death sequence, the head gets locked down to the
animations, so the x's show up in the right spot.  I did a mario
tossing the star for fun during the idle, and after Craig took a
look at it, we made it specific to certain skins.  I also rewrote
the shaders and skin files because I renamed the mesh objects in
MAX when I animated it."
"Thanks to Craig for letting me work on this one.  It was a blast."
