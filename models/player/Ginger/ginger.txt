=============================================================================

This model was originally a solid created as a cookie in the oven by DocRock for
his new map Camper_Rats.

I extracted the model from the RMF in DXF format, imported the DXF into milkshape,
cleaned it up, textured it and added the standard HLDM player animations (whew).

I also created a monster model version that matched the original cookie for the map.

All of the graphics work was done using Microsoft Imager2, Wally, Photostyler,
mgi Photosuite, and any other tool that let me do what I needed.

All the compiling and decompiling, mesh, texture, skeleton and animation work
was done in Milkshape 1.6.5.

Ginger.mdl - The HLDM player version of the game Ginger model file
Ginger.bmp - The picture you see when selecting the model in the game
Ginger.txt - This text file

Place Ginger.mdl, Ginger.bmp, Ginger.jpg and Ginger.txt in a
new folder called Ginger, in valve\models\player folder in your Half
Life directory.
