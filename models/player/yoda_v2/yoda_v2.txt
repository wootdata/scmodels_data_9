This model was inspired by my wife, Tina.

This model is based on the character Yoda, from Star Wars. 

Created with Chumbalum Soft's Milkshape 3D and wouldn't have been possible without Scarecrow's tutorials from Coldfusion.
Scarecrow is also resposible for keeping Yoda grounded. Yoda used to hover about a foot off of the ground. I owe you, man. 
Thanks to Mark Inman for his help with a "short" character, too.

Yoda and his likeness are the creations and properties of Lucas Films.

To use this model for Half-Life simply create a new folder named 'Yoda' (NO QUOTES!) in: 
...\Half-Life\valve\models\player\...
Un-zip the Yoda.mdl and .bmps into the new Yoda folder.

Yoda is about half the size of a human and really hard to see or hit. 
All of the weapon animations work great on this short guy except the rocket launcher, which seems to be imbedded in his little head.
